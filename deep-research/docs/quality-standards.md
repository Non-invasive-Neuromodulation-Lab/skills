## Quality Standards

1. ⚠️ **IRON RULE**: **Every claim must have a citation** — no unsupported assertions
2. **Evidence hierarchy** — meta-analyses > RCTs > cohort studies > case reports > expert opinion (field-neutral baseline; grading is **discipline-relative** — a source meeting its own field's gold standard can reach Grade A even at a low design level. See `../references/source_quality_hierarchy.md` §Grading Rubric + §Field-Specific Adjustments)
3. **Contradiction disclosure** — if sources disagree, report both sides with evidence quality comparison
4. **Limitation transparency** — every report must have an explicit limitations section
5. **AI disclosure** — all reports include a statement that AI-assisted research tools were used
6. **Reproducibility** — search strategies, inclusion criteria, and analytical methods must be documented for replication
7. **Socratic integrity** — while non-generation Socratic mode is active, never give direct answers; always guide through questions. A candidate response is lawful only after the explicit exit marker and is outside that mode.
## Cross-Agent Quality Alignment

Unified definitions across all agents. ⚠️ IRON RULE: **CRITICAL severity** = issue that would invalidate a core conclusion or constitute academic misconduct. Requires immediate resolution.

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill is domain-agnostic but can be combined with domain-specific skills:

```
deep-research + tw-hei-intelligence     -> Evidence-based HEI policy research
deep-research + report-to-website       -> Interactive research report
deep-research + podcast-script-generator -> Research podcast
deep-research + academic-paper          -> Full research-to-publication pipeline
deep-research (socratic) + academic-paper (plan) -> Guided research + paper planning
deep-research (systematic-review) + academic-paper -> PRISMA systematic review paper
```

## Model Tiering (#517, optional)

When `ARS_MODEL_TIERING` is set, the dispatching session routes this skill's agents per `../shared/model_tiering.md` (canonical: the full 39-agent judgment/execution table + rules). Compact rule:

- **Unset (default):** every agent inherits the session model — byte-equivalent pre-#517 behavior.
- **`economy`** (frontier-tier session): execution-type agents dispatch ONE tier below the session model — floor Opus-class, never lower; judgment-type agents stay on the session model. No-op at or below the floor (announce once).
- **`quality-boost`** (below-frontier session): judgment-type agents at the checkpoint surfaces (Stage 2.5/4.5 gates; the opt-in Stage 4→5 claim–ref audit; final review) jump UP to the frontier tier (however many tiers away — not a single increment); nothing is ever downgraded. No-op at the frontier (announce once).
- Unknown values → warn once, behave as unset. Tiers are relative positions, never hard-pinned model ids. When a direction is active, route repeated same-stage calls to the SAME worker so its prompt cache accumulates; unset means dispatch shapes stay byte-equivalent too.
